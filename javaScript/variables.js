/* Challenge: Storing Personal Information
MVP:
Create three variables to store your first name, last name and age.
Assign values to these variables.
Print a string containing all three variables in the console (should look like "Hi, my name is XXX XXX and I am XX years old) */

let firstName = "Roche";
let lastName = "Gador";
let age = 33;

console.log(`Hi, my name is ${firstName} ${lastName} and I am ${age} years old.`)
